# Tello_EDU
This is a gem for programmatically controlling a Ryze Tello EDU or a DJI Tello Talent drone from scripts in thr Ruby language.

It is initially inspired by a fine gem https://github.com/blacktm/tello

Some reasons for writing this gem:
* to support SDK v.2.0: commands for Tello EDU variant - for swarming and mission pads recognition;
* to support SDK v.3.0: commands for Tello Talent variant - for controlling drone and RMTT;
* to implement additional commands based on 'RC' command from Tello SDK;


The work is in progress so far.
