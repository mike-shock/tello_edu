# Tello_EDU
This is a gem for programmatically controlling a Ryze Tello EDU / DJI Tello Talent drone from scripts in thr Ruby language.
It is inspired by a fine gem https://github.com/blacktm/tello

Some reasons for writing this gem:
* to support SDK v.3.0;
* to implement additional commands based on 'RC' command from Tello SDK;


The work is in progress so far.
